# SWT391_Final_Project
This is a Jewelry Production Order System repository for SWT391-NET1806 in SUMMER2024 . 
The Jewellery Production Ordering System is a new software system that replaces the current manual directly at shops for ordering and picking up jewellery. The system is expected to evolve over several releases, ultimately connecting to the Internet ordering services to payment online.
Users:
● 	Customers: End users who can successfully place orders online by selecting a design and customise jewellery details.
● 	Sales Staff: Sales staff who will receive requirements from customers, confirm, quote a price for customers, and handover the product to the customer.
● 	Design Staff: Design staff who will receive requirements from customers after accepting the price, upload the 3D design based on what customers require.
● 	Managers: Managers who can evaluate customer requests and give prices to sales staff, manage the order and manage the price for material.
● 	Administrators (Admin): Administrators have access to management, company design management, and view dashboard.
