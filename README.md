# SWT391_Final_Project
This is a Jewelry Production Order System repository for SWT391-NET1806 in SUMMER2024 . 
The Jewellery Production Ordering System is a new software system that replaces the current manual directly at shops for ordering and picking up jewellery. The system is expected to evolve over several releases, ultimately connecting to the Internet ordering services to payment online.
